CS 300 Module Eight Journal

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The course presented us with various projects that allowed us to enhance our skills in solving problems related to data structures and algorithms. For the first project, we were able to analyze the runtime and memory usage of different data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. The second project enabled us to sort and print a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order, which was a great opportunity for us to apply our knowledge in a practical setting.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
When presented with a challenge, my methodology involves thoroughly understanding the problem statement and requirements before selecting the most appropriate data structure for the task at hand. This approach enables me to optimize data manipulation and ensure efficient problem-solving. I employ various techniques such as algorithm implementation and code optimization to achieve better performance and memory usage, ultimately leading to more effective solutions.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
Throughout my learning journey, I faced some challenges that helped me grow as a student. One of the significant obstacles was understanding the nuances of various data structures and their implementation details. I tackled this challenge by utilizing my resources effectively and seeking help from my peers and instructors. In Project Two, I encountered a difficulty in implementing the sorting algorithm correctly. However, I approached this problem constructively by breaking it down into smaller parts, testing each part separately, and then integrating them into a working solution. These challenges have taught me valuable lessons on the importance of perseverance, resourcefulness and problem-solving skills.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I have found working on these projects to be a valuable learning experience that has helped me to further refine my skills in designing software and developing programs. I have gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms, and how to weigh the trade-offs between different data structures to choose the optimal one that aligns with the specific problem requirements. Moreover, I have learned to prioritize testing, optimization, and documentation as essential components in producing high-quality software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I am proud to share that my experience working on these projects has profoundly influenced my programming capabilities. Through this experience, I have become more adept at writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, thanks to the emphasis on modular design, clear and concise code, and commenting. Moreover, I have learned to identify and handle edge cases and errors proactively, and I have gained an appreciation for refactoring code to enhance readability and maintainability. Overall, the experience of working on these projects has helped me to become a better programmer, and I am excited to continue building upon the skills that I have acquired.
